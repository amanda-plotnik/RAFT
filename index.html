              Home &gt; Is Spring Awakening (2019) Too Controvertial?
            </div>
            <h3>Is <i> Spring Awakening </i> (2019) Too Controvertial?</h3>
              <p>
                When the 2006 musical <i> Spring Awakening </i> opened, it was a shock to audiences as its 1891 source material was before it. The work's themes of religion, sex, and suicide seem to be constantly topical, which was yet again proven when the first previews of the new film adaptation were released. Many have found the decision to use actors true to the ages of the young characters (14-15) troubling. In interviws, director Sylvia Jones defended the decision, saying that "censoring the film would be contrary to the themes," in recent interview. Jones has also promised a focus on the themes that remain controvertial, specifically mentioning rape and LGBT identites. Despite media backlash, the film remains in production. There's an irony in 21st century audiences still being skeptical of a 19th century story which was meant as a cautionary tale. As a society, we're missing the point. Assuming it remains fairly true to it's source, 2019's <i> Spring Awakening </i> will cover these topics, that we all seem to need to be beaten on the head with once again: 
              </p>
            <h4> Sexual Education </h4>
              <p>
                This may be the most obvious theme in <i> Spring Awakening</i>. Even to this day, many people are worried that sexual education will corrupt youth. Those who think that way often forget that young peopel will begin to have questions about sexuality regardless of whether or not they are given answers. From the beginning of the musical, Wendla (our female lead) is curious about sex. Her longing and questioning quickly turn to anger in her song "Mama Who Bore Me" after her mother shys away from answering her questions. This curiosity becomes a driving force for Wendla's character arc, and even after her rape she fails to fully understand her own sexuality. Her experiences with sex are few, consisting of only what she learns from a school friend who is sexually abused by her father and from her rebellious male friend Melchior's crude understanding of the topic. To this day, many children Wendla's age are able to learn about sexuality from improper sources. Modern media gives a depiction equally as crude and patriarchal as Melchior's take on the subject. If the events of <i> Spring Awakening </i> were to take place in modern day, perhaps Wendla would stumble across porn online and learn of sexuality that way. It seems unlikely this would have endowed her with information that could have saved her from her fate. <i> Spring Awakening </i> tells us what many still don't understand: sexual education is crucial for responsible exploration of sexuality.
              </p>
            <h4> Abortion </h4>
              <p>
                Speaking of Wendla, the young girl's lack of sexual education puts her in a situation where she becomes pregnant without realizing it. Despite Wendla herself accepting this, her mother forces her into an abortion. The improper procedure leads to Wendla's death. Was the main problem that abortion was <i> too </i> accessible? No. Wendla's mother would have forced her into the abortion regardless. The objectively better outcome would have been if the procedure was performed by a legitimate, trustworthy doctor and Wendla had survived it. The fact that abortion was illegal was not a deterrent in 19th century Germany and it certainly is not one now. <i> Spring Awakening </i> implicitly shows that despite one's personal feelings on abortions, <b> they will happen anyway and outlawing them leads to unnecessary deaths. </b> It's almost hard to believe this play was written in 1891.
              </p>
            <h4>Religion</h4>
              <p>
                Melchior is cool. He's attractive, clever, knowledgable, but above all that is rebellious. When we are first introduced to Melchior, he gives a soliloquy about his hatred of the social order and its reliance on religion ("All That's Known"). He seems to be the only student in his class willing to speak out against how unfair the system is, but even Melchior wouldn't think to speak publicly against religion. Does religion have a place in society? Certainly. Should one religion be forced on an entire society? Of course not. Melchior is depicted as an avid atheist who rejects all religion, however he lives in a time period where alternative beliefs are not tolerated. Rather than feel isolated, Melchior fervently believes he is correct, and that religion only hinders academic pursuits. This is a surprisingly good picture of what modern society looks like. Rather than accept each others' belief systems, many people refuse to respect another faith, which will cause people of that faith to reject them, and so on and so forth. Increasingly, people are coming to respect other faiths, but accepting a system that is completely incompatable with yours can be difficult. Melchior also seems to argue for complete secularization of government and academics. Considering the prevalence of multifaith communities, perhaps Melchior was on to something. It can, after all, be quite polarizing to hear the US President say "God bless America" after every address.
              </p>
            <h4>Sexual Abuse</h4>
              <p>
                It should come as no surprise that a musical with strong themes of religion also discusses sexual abuse of children. The issue has long been swept under the rug by the Church, though <i> Spring Awakening </i> brings it to the forefront in the song "The Dark I Know Well" in which two of the young female characters discuss their experiences with sexual assault. The song strays from the traditional innocence that would be expected from girls discussing such a topic. These girls are not confused or conflicted. They are angry, and they have every right to be. Rather than portray the victims as helpless and pitiful, they stand strong in the face of their experiences. One character, Ilse, is described in exposition by her friends as having attempted to speak out against the abuse she faced, which caused her to be kicked out of her own home and run away to join an artist's troupe. Ilse seems like she would be a strong supporter of the #MeToo movement, and a feminist hero in her own right for standing up for herself. Despite her bravery, Ilse was still ultimately silenced, which has always been a harsh reality faced by sexual abuse and assault victims. With any luck, seeing such a young girl discuss such experiences will change some people's minds about the importance of creating spaces for people to discuss sexual assault without fear of harassment.
              </p>
            <h4>Same-Sex Relationships</h4>
              <p>
                The middle of act II of the musical introduces the audience to a short side plot: the secret romance between two schoolboys Ernst and Hanschen. Portraying same-sex relationships at all was ambitious for an 1891 play, however most recently it has caused more unrest for the ages of the characters (who, again, are around 14). Previews of the film have shown more integration of Ernst and Hanschen's relationship through the story, including a scene where Ernst discusses the relationship with another boy only to be met with laughter and assumption that he isn't serious. Ernst himself often faces teasing from classmates who believe him to be gay, however Hanschen is seen as strong and masculine and often flirts with girls. Some have raised concerns that a character like Hanschen would force young viewers to question their sexuality, as he is portrayed as bisexual and does not fit a stereotype. A commonly cited reason for this is that both Ernst and Hanschen are too young to understand their own sexualities. It seems hypocritical that people who claim to be accepting of same-sex relationships refuse to allow them to be portrayed in the same light that heterosexual relationships are shown. The assumption that being shown same-sex relationships will force children to "become gay" is baseless and inherently homophobic, especially since those who support the notion are always quite accepting of children choosing to be heterosexual. It is also important to recognize that in addressing same-sex relationships, the film also looks at stereotyping and bullying that comes with questioning one's identity, which is an important topic for people to be exposed to, as it shows how their actions can affect others. Ernst and Hanschen's duet "The Word of your Body (Reprise)" is nothing short of a beautiful moment where the two learn to accept themselves, and the film would be incomplete without the source material's side plot.
              </p>
            <h4>Suicide</h4>
              <p>
                Moritz, Mechior's best friend, seems to be constantly worrying. He worries about his academic achievement, his father's reaction to his shortcomings, and his sexual thoughts (he's quite religious). Moritz is first seen considering suicide in "And Then There Were None" where he sends letters to Melchior's mother seeking her help to run away from home. Eventually, the pressures become too much and with no support available to him, Moritz takes his own life ("Don't Do Sadness"). The issues that Moritz struggled with are still faced by students today; academics become increasingly focused on perfection and parental pressures continue to be pervasive. Despite the constant pressure on young people, support for mental health issues is still lacking, and suicides continue to plague high schools and universities. The reasons behind Moritz's suicide is worth having discussions about because it remains a major issue. The public school system continues to have dismal student support, and it seems that students killing themselves is not enough of a reason to improve this. Even Melchior, the haughty protagonist, considers suicide near the musical's conclusion and is only stopped by the ghost of his recently deceased friend Moritz. The discussion on suicide and student mental health has been ongoing for years, and it seems unlikely that <i>Spring Awakening</i> will effect too much change, but one can only hope. 
              </p>
            <h4>Rape</h4>
              <p>
                Melchior rapes Wendla. There is no way around it. Melchior seems like an okay guy for most of the musical, and depending on the performance Wendla is sometimes even shown as consenting to sex, but even those portrayals miss something crucial: Wendla doesn't know what sex is. Since she doesn't understand what is happening or what she is agreeing to (and Melchior does), she cannot meaningfully consent. Melchior's misogynistic attitude is foreshadowed when he discusses sex with Melchior in "Touch Me" and frankly states that he doesn't care how sex feels for the woman involved.
